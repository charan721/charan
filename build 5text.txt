 IRA started on the humble belief of transparency in ethics and the vision to change the status quo of the real estate sector, which formed the backbone of our success. We believe the culmination of our passion for building world-class urban communities, quality design, innovation and sustainability, yields exceptional communities and experiences where our customers live, work, and play. Over the years, we have stayed true to our motto – Love for Humanity!

Welcome Ira
JOIN THE REVOLUTION
We believe what we did yesterday is not enough for tomorrow. As a customer, your real investment should not be restricted to just the apartment, plot or property. With IRA Realty, you get a share in the company too.

Investor Realty Army, what you know as IRA, aim to create a community of equal individuals who live together and grow together as part of a revolutionary movement that disrupts the norm. When you pick IRA, you become part of our army. You don't just get your dream house, you get a part of IRA's shares along with it. Our common goal is prosperity backed by good intentions to break away from a capitalistic society and move towards development for all. We are set on our path to create a new reality for the industry by coming up with simple solutions to complex problems, and as you join us on this path, you are now the revolution!
 We aim to offer added value to our customers by providing a “whole of life” client support programme to assist in ensuring the best outcome. From the time we start the research phase with you to establish size, budget, and style, through to design, construction, and the moment you move in — our streamlined processes allow you to make decisions on your investment with clarity, all with one point of contact throughout the journey.
“Treating customers with a level of respect and providing prompt service always is at the heart of everything we do”
